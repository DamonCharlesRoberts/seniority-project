\section{Important Notes}
\subsection{Data Sources}
* [Brookings' Vital Statistics on Congress](https://www.brookings.edu/multi-chapter-report/vital-statistics-on-congress/)
* [Volden and Woon's Data on House and Senate Legislative Effectiveness](https://thelawmakers.org/data-download)
* [FiveThirtyEight's Age of MC's over time data](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/congress-age)

\subsection{Theory}

Seniority does not necessarily imply that the particular MC is important for the success of the party in electoral and legislative outcomes. Other factors such as having an electoral-stronghold in their respective districts, legislative effectiveness, media coverage, etc. are all incentives for the parties to move away from the seniority rule (perhaps why it was done in the 1970's - some argue that it was to further help with the strengthening of parties in insitutions).

\section{What I've found so far}

\subsection{Both chambers are getting older over time (?)}
